    </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles, preferably no-boil noodles</li>
        <li>Whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
        <li>Red sauce or spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>Mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano cheese</li>
        <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fontina cheese</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly oil a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish or spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix the ricotta, mascarpone, parmesan, salt, pepper, and beaten egg in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread one cup of sauce over the bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Place 3 to 4 lasagna noodles down, overlapping them slightly. Depending on your dish, you might need to break a noodle into smaller pieces to fill any gaps.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta-mascarpone mixture over the noodles, then scatter half of the basil leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Add a second layer of noodles, and then spread 1 cup of sauce over them.</li>
        <li>Scatter half of the mozzarella cheese and half of the fontina cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a third layer of noodles, spread the remaining ricotta-mascarpone mixture over them, and then scatter the remaining basil leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Finish with the fourth layer of noodles and spread the remaining sauce on top (about 1 cup). Finally, finish with the remaining mozzarella and fontina cheeses.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna uncovered until the cheese bubbles and the noodles cook; about 30 minutes. For a golden-brown top, broil for an additional one to two minutes. If your dish is filled to the top, consider placing it onto a baking sheet before baking in the oven to prevent any oven mess from overflowing cheese and sauce.</li>
